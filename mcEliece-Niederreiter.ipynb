    "# Classic McEliece and Niederreiter with Binary Goppa Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a notebook by Felix Paul inspired by the work of Michiel Marcus under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Tanja Lange.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook presents the McEliece cryptosystem and the Niederreiter cryptosystem in its (insecure) textbook version. It is based on this <a href=\"https://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/students/m_marcus/whitepaper.pdf\"> Whitepaper </a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To just use the code set verbose=0.\n",
    "- For a description of all the necessary steps set verbose = 1.\n",
    "- For educational purposes and debugging set verbose=2.\n",
    "- The verbosity is set in each called function so you can see each step during the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For technical reasons, additional restrictions are imposed on the polynomials here, which are theoretically not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of unforeseen errors, it is recommended to rerun all previous code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bits from the original document will be used to clarify which parts of the code belong to which parts of the whitepaper. Please note that for larger parameters it might take a longer time to display the output. Additionally, please be warned that the code used in the notebook is **not** safe to use in real-world applications. This code is purely meant for educational purposes and is prone to side-channel attacks. Additionally, due to technical reasons there are some restrictions on the polynomials, which reduces the security even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the notebook sets up a binary Goppa code step-by-step, so that the user can play with values and see how it works. After creating the binary Goppa code, the notebook shows how the code is used in the McEliece cryptographic system. The user is encouraged to edit and re-run the code as they like. A selected cell can be re-run by clicking the _run_ button in the top menu or using _shift + enter_."

    "The first order of business is creating the binary Goppa code. Recall that we have 3 parameters to specify:\n",

As we divide by $g(\\sigma_i(z))$ during the computation of the parity check matrix, we would then divide by $0$. This requirement is a result of the limited choices that are reasonable to make in Sage. Normally this is not a requirement as in general, $t$ is much bigger than $m$.\n",

    "Lastly, $n = k + t*m$ , so $n$ can in theory have any value between $t \\cdot m + 1$ and $2^m$, because in the smallest case $k = 1$ and in the largest case we can use all the elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. Note that $n$ and $k$ are security parameters, so choosing them with care is important."

This means that we can simply take a random permutation of the support elements to get this part done. However, if $n < 2^m$ we will give away information on the original support if we simply permute the elements we chose.
